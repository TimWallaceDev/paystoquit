# paystoquit

MISSION
This is an app to help people quit their bad habits. I began working on this app while quitting vaping. The premice is that you stop the bad (or expensive) habit, and use the money saved to reward yourself. The site is flexible and can accomodate any number of bad habits you wish to work on. Users can also add any rewards they choose. 

IMPLEMENTATION
This website was built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The auto generated image URLs are being fetched from an API endpoint I set up specifically for this app. 

All storage is done via browser LocalStorage. This means that if you clear out the data from your browser all data will be lost. On the upside, this also means that all user data remains on their device which is nice for those privacy minded individuals. I hope create a feature soon that will enable users to save data in database if they so choose; allowing them to use the app accross multiple devices. I have noticed that some web browsers clear out localstoage data once you close the browser, meaning everytime you visit this site all your data is reset.
